![Architecture](https://github.com/filippoengidashet/Market-Products-App/blob/main/files/arch.png)

* The App is architected using Google’s recommended pattern
* It survives continuous operation on the model side even on screen rotation, then once the view is ready it’ll be automatically reflected via the vie model
* Is not gonna cause any memory leak as it’s tied to the component lifecycle (Activity)

#### Additional Notes

* Scrolling through the list can be tedious, having a search/filter functionality can be something to add in the future
* Design can be improved with great looks, UI/UX, colours and typography
